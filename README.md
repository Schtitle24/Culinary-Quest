## User Story
As a user who loves exploring new cities and trying out different restaurants, I need an app that simplifies the process of finding and organizing restaurant bucket lists for each city I plan to visit. This app should have clear navigation, easy search functionality, and the ability to create and save personalized lists for future reference.

When I load the homepage, I am presented with a section for header, content, and footer.

When I view the header, it contains Title and a Login/Sign-up button.
